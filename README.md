# simple-obex
A Java library for generation and parsing of OBEX (Object exchange) messages.

## What is OBEX? ##

[OBEX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBject_EXchange) is a protocol for communication between devices. It is used with Bluetooth and USB.

You probably have used OBEX if you have sent a file with Bluetooth.

## Why a new library? ##

I tried to understand other libraries, but couldn't.

## How can I use it? ##

See the application in the example package.
